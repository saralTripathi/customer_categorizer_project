Problem statement  : 

In this data science project, you will build a machine learning system which will be able predict the personality of the customer using machine learning algorithms. 
This project will be very usefull for malls, various stores and companies which are product based. Based on customer's personal details and purchase details, 
we can cluster them and we can predict the customer's cluster number using classification techniques.

Solution Proposed :

Now the question is how to dynamically predict the cluster of the customer ?.
One of the approaches which we can use of machine learning approach,
where we can cluster the customer based on the details we have and predict the cluster type based on the domain knowledge and leverage previous customer data to predict the cluster.
